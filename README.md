sandbox for our shiny apps


## bulletr

This app walks through the steps used to determine the probability that two bullets were fired from the same gun barrel. We compare at the bullet land level.
To begin, choose or upload two .x3p files representing the two bullet lands you wish to compare.

## x3pviewer

The x3p-viewer allows to view files in x3p or x-y-z (`dat` file extension) format, while subsampling (Downsampling factor).
Surfaces are rendered using rgl, enabling some user interaction, such as rotations and zoom.
Use right mouse button to copy or save images in png format.

A csv file of the groove locations for the land can be downloaded.
